specifying_speaker:
for any command that operates on speakers you can specify either 1, more than 1, or all speakers.
- commands and speaker names are not case sensitive
- when specifying a speaker name with spaces you can keep them or replace them with underscores.
  you can use any of the following to indicate a speaker named \Office Speaker\
  \"office speaker\", office\ speaker, office_speaker, speaker_office, office, speaker
- you only need to specify as many words as are required to uniquely identify the speaker from 
  other speakers. The first speaker to match the given keywords will be returned, and there are no
  guarantees on which one will be returned first if there are multiple matches.
  word order does not matter.
- you can also specify a speaker by its id, which you can see by running \'{args[0]} all table\'

<volume> can be specified as any of the following:
\t- a number from 0.0 to 1.0 with up to 8 digits of precision
\t- a percentage from 0% to 100%

\t- any of the following will set volume to 0.0
{OFF}
\t- any of the following will set volume to 0.5
{MIDDLE}
\t- any volume between 1 and 100 will be treated as a percentage
\t- any volume < 0 will be rounded up to 0
